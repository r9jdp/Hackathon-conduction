To illustrate the agreement trap, if you send Terms and Conditions to 1,000 partners or customers annually, tracking expiration dates for renewals becomes a challenge. The key lies in the data within these agreements.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Hackathon developers should create solutions that enable businesses to streamline workflows and automate processes that maximize the value of their agreement data.

The platform should be capable of:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Detecting Bias in Citizen-Collected Climate Data</strong>: Implementing bias detection algorithms to identify and mitigate potential biases in climate data sourced from TARTLE, a citizen science platform. The platform should utilize statistical analysis, Bayesian models, and multi-method bias correction techniques to ensure the data's reliability and address the inherent challenges of citizen-collected climate records.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Generating Explainable AI Predictions</strong>: Developing an AI model that makes climate predictions at a local level using bias-corrected data. The AI model should be transparent\u2014using techniques like LIME, SHAP, or Feature Importance Scores\u2014to explain how it arrives at its predictions, ensuring accessibility and clarity for users.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Visualizing Localized Climate Impacts</strong>: Creating an immersive visualization tool overlaps NOAA's public climate data with personal observations collected through TARTLE. The platform should provide a holistic view of local climate change impacts by combining scientific measurements with individual observations. To enhance user engagement and comprehension, it must feature interactive elements like heat maps, time-series charts, and geospatial mapping.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The resulting platform should adhere to ethical AI principles, focusing on data privacy, informed consent, and transparency.

Think of it as a friendly and easy-to-understand tool, designed to help Bitcoiners, educators, and curious learners all over the world explore how Bitcoin works in real-time.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>It\u2019s not just about coding</strong>; it\u2019s about making Bitcoin education fun, clear, and accessible for everyone. Think of it like <a href=\"http://www.mempool.space\">www.mempool.space</a>, but simpler, more colorful, and more relatable!<br/><br/></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>End goal of the Hackathon:</strong><br/>By the end of the 2 weeks hackathon (on the 24th of January), your group should present a fully functional and deployed website that meets the following requirements:</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>1. Make a Game plan:</strong> Get together in your team, create a concept, organize yourself, and distribute responsibilities.<br/><strong>2. Set Up a Server:</strong>\u00a0Ensure your application is hosted and accessible.<br/></span><span><strong>3. Secure a Domain: </strong>Use a memorable domain to make your site easy to find.<br/></span><span><strong>4. Fork the Repository: </strong>Build your version of Bitcoin City by forking this repository and adapting it to be Bitcoin-only.<br/></span><span><strong>5. Add Lightning Network Visualization: </strong>Include a fun and interactive representation of Lightning transactions (these can be simulated, not live).<br/></span><span><strong>6. Enable Split-Screen Mode: </strong>Make it possible to view Bitcoin and Lightning transactions side-by-side.<br/></span><span><strong>7. Integrate your own Lightning Transaction feature: </strong>For example:<br/></span><span>- A QR code where someone can send sats, and their transaction triggers a visual representation (e.g., a character or object appears on the screen linked to the transaction).<br/></span><span>- A QR code where users can send sats to display a global message in real-time.<br/></span><span>- A faucet feature allowing users to claim their first sats for free, with the option to spend them directly on the site.<br/></span><span><strong>8. Make It Open-Source: </strong>Publish your final project on GitHub for the community to use and improve.</span></p>\n<h5 id=\"about-the-challenge\"></h5>\n</div>",

Weather it comes to poverty, disease, quality of life, life expectancy, or any other indicator of global development, we are significantly better off than we were just a couple decades ago. Did you know that, according to\n  <a href=\"https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/chart-85-of-new-electricity-built-in-2023-was-clean-energy\">\n   Canary Media\n  </a>\n  , over 85% of new electricity generation infrastructure utilizes renewable energy? That means the switch to renewables is already well underway.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There are many other examples of such surprising facts. The reason we find them surprising is that news sites and social media often produces content that focuses on negative or sensational stories. They often talk about war, crisis, and disaster, but fail to mention positive trends in society. This false perception has significant impact on society. For example, despite that statistic about climate change, there are still many people who believe climate change is inevitable. That's because they are simply unaware of what humans are doing to combat climate change. Such beliefs can be very dangerous. People who belive that climate change is inevitable, for example, are much less likely to donate to a charity that combats climate change or vote for a presidential candidate who makes climate change one of their higher priorities.\n </p>\n <p>\n  MindTheGap Challenge brings together High School students from around the world to fight such devastating ignorance. Participants will use code to build solutions that will raise awareness about topics like world poverty and climate change. This is a great opportunity for high school students who are passionate about coding and want to use their skills to build something novel that solves a real problem and has a real impact on the world. Even beyond that, this event is a great way to network with other like-minded high school students who are also passionate about coding and start networking.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Don't know how to code? We've got you covered.\n  </strong>\n  Throughout the challenge, we will be hosting several workshops teaching several topics. This includes basic HTML/CSS, JS frameworks, how to build a backend for your website, and even how you can build mobile apps using react native.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Don't have a team? That's ok too.\n  </strong>\n  When you register, you will get an invite to a discord sever where you can meet new people and form a team.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Want to learn more about the Ignorance Project?\n  </strong>\n  Click\n  <a href=\"https://www.gapminder.org/ignorance/\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n</article>\n",

It's being developed for work applications, gaming, relaxation, physical therapy, and telehealth. One of VR's advantages is that it allows remote, real-time, visual communication that can include body positioning and movement. This is especially important for those with limited mobility or challenges traveling significant distances. In modern medical practice, VR has the potential to provide a solution space to get more patients seeing specialists that they normally would not be able to see.</p>\n<p>In genetic medicine, it's common practice to schedule patients with multiple specialists on the same day. This limits trips to the hospital, but it means patients will sit in a doctor's office examination room for multiple hours at a time while specialists of various types (cardiology, pulmonary, gastroenterology, genetics, etc.) rotate through. In this challenge, participants are asked to use VR to create an entertaining, relaxing environment that patients can enjoy while at home that also includes areas where specialists can conduct examinations of the patient, talk with family members, and consult with each other. Note that each of the above has different requirements for privacy and security. Think about how you would address those in your solution.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Challenge #2: Exploration for Astronaut Nutrition</p>\n<p>Nutrigenomics studies how genetic variations influence responses to nutrients, which is especially important for long-duration spaceflight missions. This challenge invites participants to explore nutrigenomics, focusing on the genetic complexities of plant-based food for astronauts in space. Currently, astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS) receive food resupply shipments that fulfill nutritional needs. However, the degradation of vitamins over time renders carrying all nutritional necessities for deep space missions impossible and inefficient. The alternative is growing fresh produce in space, a challenge NASA is preparing for future exploration.</p>\n<p>In Huntsville, \"The Rocket City,\" continuing the legacy of researchers with innovative ideas is crucial. This challenge does not involve solving the complexities of growing vegetables in zero gravity; instead, it focuses on determining the optimal diet for astronauts. Imagine a crew one year from a deep space mission. NASA has tasked you with a bioinformatic project to identify the optimal vegetables for each astronaut's needs in space, aiming for a report on the essential dietary requirements shared among the crew to optimize payload weight for nutritional resources. This challenge comprises two main tasks: designing a bioinformatic solution for given nutrigenomic data and providing a comprehensive report on nutritional discoveries to support future human exploration.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Challenge #3: ChaTCGA</p>\n<p>Over the last several decades, publicly available multi-omics datasets have grown significantly. This data availability has allowed researchers to develop artificial intelligence and machine learning models to predict risk, prognosis, and therapies for many different diseases and conditions. However, there are situations where datasets are not publicly available and cannot be shared due to privacy or security concerns. Therefore, the ability to create \u201cmimic\u201d data from these datasets and then use the mimic to train models is critical.</p>\n<p>In this project, you will use The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)\u2019s lung adenocarcinoma gene expression dataset as the secure source dataset. TCGA paper: <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13385\">https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13385</a>. Lung cancer accounts for approximately 28% of cancer deaths, and the prognosis for patients with advanced cancer is a 16% survival rate after five years. Models that predict/classify tumor vs. normal tissue, tumor stages, or survival are all important tools for bioinformaticians and have far-reaching impacts on tools for physicians.</p>\n<p>For this challenge, participants are asked to use an AI/ML approach to create a mimic dataset that captures the variation found within a secure source dataset, develop an AI/ML predictive model using the mimic dataset, and validate the newly developed model back on the secure source dataset.</p>\n</div>",

Just like rock n' roll challenged norms and created a new wave of artistic expression, we encourage hackers to push boundaries, think outside the box, and create solutions that are as innovative as they are daring. Whether you're here to build your portfolio, network with sponsors, or connect with a passionate community, UGAHacks X is your stage to showcase your unique rhythm and make some noise!\n </p>\n <h4 class=\"h2-title\" id=\"a-place-for-everyone\">\n  A place for everyone\n </h4>\n <p>\n  <span>\n   The UGAHacks organization prides itself on our beginner friendly environment.

Make it sleek, make it weird, make it fun, and make it unique! \n      </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Uniquely suited to Reddit</strong><br/>\n        Your game should be designed to bring together a community of users. Think massively multiplayer. Make use of flair, comments, leaderboards, or other Reddit-y mechanics.

Labels like \"bug,\" \"feature,\" or \"help wanted\" should be used to ensure clarity, with the \u201cHelp Needed\u201d label specifically signalling mentors for support. Visualising workflows through GitHub Project Boards with columns such as \"To Do,\" \"In Progress,\" and \"Done\" is highly recommended.

Dependency management should include a requirements.txt file listing all necessary libraries and tools, simplifying setup for reviewers and teammates. Regularly testing the environment setup ensures that the README instructions are accurate and complete.\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n </p>\n <p>\n </p>\n</article>\n",

Youth turnout still trails behind older generations, and significant gaps remain. In 2022, Black (15%) and Latino (14%) youth turnout lagged nearly 10 percentage points behind the overall youth rate, while youth with a Bachelor\u2019s degree outvoted their peers with only a high school diploma by a massive 30 points.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Enter the GTVO (Get the Vote Out) hackathon\u2014a game-changing invention-based learning experience where technologists, subject-matters experts, and youth changemakers unite to create solutions that energize and activate their generation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It\u2019s more than a hackathon...\n </p>\n <p>\n  We are here to inspire democracy -- TOGETHER!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Let\u2019s build bold tools, drive change, and make sure every young voice roars at the ballot box.

The Hackathon Begins (Kick-off) \u25cf Introduction Session: o On the day of the event, the organizers usually provide an orientation session where the rules, judging criteria, and technical resources are explained. 3. Development Phase \u25cf Coding &amp; Prototyping: o The core of the hackathon is the coding phase, which lasts around 18-20 hours. Teams develop their projects from scratch, using various tools, technologies. \u25cf Collaborating: o Teams should maintain effective communication throughout the event, working together to tackle challenges, debug code, and integrate components. This is critical since time is extremely limited. 4. Progress Check-ins (Midway) \u25cf Optional Check-ins: o Progress check-ins during the 24-hour period where teams share updates on their work, receive feedback, and ensure they are on track. o This helps teams re-align if they face technical blockers or need advice on improving their solution. 5. Final Stage (Presentation &amp; Submission) \u25cf Wrapping Up the Code: o As the 24-hour deadline approaches, teams begin wrapping up their projects. This includes ensuring that the project is functional, integrating all components, and preparing a working demo. \u25cf Presentation Preparation (23-24 Hours): o Teams need to prepare their final pitch and presentation slides. Typically, teams have 5-10 minutes to present their project to the judges. o The presentation should include: \u25aa Problem definition \u25aa The solution they\u2019ve built and how it solves the problem \u25aa Demo of the working prototype \u25aa Technologies and tools used \u25aa The impact and scalability of the solution 6. Submission: \u25cf Code Submission: o Teams usually need to submit their source code, project files, and any relevant documentation via an online portal (e.g., GitHub, Google Drive) by the end of the 24-hour period. \u25cf Final Presentations (Judging): o Teams present their project in front of a panel of judges, which typically includes industry experts, professors, and experienced developers. The presentation is followed by a Q&amp;A session where judges ask questions to evaluate the team\u2019s problem-solving approach and understanding of the solution.\u00a0</h4>\n</div>",

Word embeddings, search algorithms, vector databases, and frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex have created a huge opportunity for improving decision-making through better knowledge management.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What to build? <strong>Apply graph RAG or similar systems to an enterprise-level problem</strong>, such as how to query a large knowledge base while doing time-sensitive work, like hospital triage or emergency services. One excellent source of data you could use is <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database\">https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database</a>. Maybe try to make it easy to query the hundreds of databases available from the European government.</p>\n<p>Or start with a RAG-based chatbot for enterprise use. Optimize your strategy for a specific use case, innovate around how to improve the quality of RAG retrieval, prompt engineering, best LLMs to use, and more. Or focus on multimodal and surface important information found in diagrams and charts, not just text. Or consider how to fine-tune an LLM with numerical data and summarize everything in one place for the user...\u00a0</p>\n<p>We are open to a wide variety of submissions. The important thing is that you leverage Graph RAG technology to solve a knowledge management problem.</p>\n<h4>What to Submit</h4>\n<p>In order to judge the submission, the jury needs access to your source code (email a Github repository link to <a href=\"mailto:info@neodatagroup.ai\">info@neodatagroup.ai</a>), and you need to present your work briefly to the public.\u00a0</p>\n</div>",

Large and corporate farms usually have the scale to integrate and operate the sophisticated technologies, business processes, etc. required to take full advantage of Agriculture 4.0. Not so much for YBS farmers and, arguably, even less so for the under-represented communities. To remove this barrier for YBS and under-represented communities, we investigated Open-Source Software where there are no license charges that would be far more affordable (and more data privacy for those who have that concern).\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <span>\n   For the Farm Credit System's definition of Young, Beginning, Small producers please see\n  </span>\n  <a href=\"https://www.fca.gov/bank-oversight/young-beginning-and-small-farmer-lending\">\n   Young, beginning, and small farmer lending | Farm Credit Administration (fca.gov)\n  </a>\n </p>\n <h4 class=\"h2-title\" id=\"get-started\">\n  Get started\n </h4>\n <p>\n  See your professor about creating an indisciplinary team (e.g., Agriculture, Computer Science, Information Management, Business)\n </p>\n</article>\n",

During the day, we will provide food, snacks, activities to earn prizes, skills workshops to help with your project, and free goodies from our sponsors.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Even though our event is called a hackathon, your brain is the only thing you'll be hacking. If you can code, feel free to write programs or program a solution for your project. And if you can't code, don't worry! You'll be at no disadvantage. You can utilize any of your skills or passions to create your project. You can make a prototype of a physical device, build a website (we'll have a workshop teaching you how), a game, or anything you can think of. We'll have volunteers and people knowledgeable in engineering, computer science, and other topics to help you with your project.

Does this offer something that hasn't been solved already? If it has been solved, does this offer something different? Can it be scaled to meet thousands or even millions of people?\n      </li>\n<li>\n<strong>20% Technical Complexity &amp; Novelty</strong><br/>\n        Technical complexity does not necessarily mean code. This could be anything, hardware designs, specialised test kits or even a complex but clear business plan. Is this an innovative solution?\n      </li>\n<li>\n<strong>20% Prototype Completion</strong><br/>\n        Is there a ready technical prototype of the solution? If yes, does it work well? Does the prototype present well the idea of the solution? How fast can the prototype be turned into a ready to use product?\n      </li>\n<li>\n<strong>20% Business Plan</strong><br/>\n        It is essential to consider the feasibility, economic and societal value, market knowledge and sustainability of the solution. What resources are needed to implement the solution?\n      </li>\n</ul>",
